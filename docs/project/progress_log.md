### Project Setup

- Set up the project files, organizing them according to the planned architecture.
- Initialized the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/nicholasgillespie/portfolio-design), ensuring all initial files were committed and pushed.

  - Installing Astro via npm to ensure the latest version is used.
  - Going through the Astro documentation to understand the basics and how it differs from Vite.
  - Setting up a basic Astro project structure to get familiar with the file organization and component system.
