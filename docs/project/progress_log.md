Spent the morning and afternoon developing an accessible reel/carousel. The following progress has been made:

- Created the basic structure of the reel/carousel using HTML and CSS, ensuring it is fully responsive and accessible.
- Implemented JavaScript to dynamically adjust the scroll position of the reel, centering the content on load. This includes handling for both even and odd numbers of items in the reel.
- Applied custom styling to the scrollbar for enhanced visual appeal, while maintaining accessibility standards.

### To-Do:

- Refine scrollbar styling for better aesthetics and accessibility.
- Add accessible "Previous" and "Next" navigation buttons with keyboard support.
- Implement CSS Scroll Snap for smooth navigation, ensuring compatibility with keyboard controls.
- Use JavaScript to conditionally hide the scrollbar on page load, maintaining it if JavaScript is disabled.
- Test and adjust keyboard navigation to ensure a logical and intuitive flow through carousel items.
